# tennis-buddy-finder

This project was created with [Better-T-Stack](https://github.com/AmanVarshney01/create-better-t-stack), a modern TypeScript stack that combines Nuxt, Convex, and more.

## Features

- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience
- **Nuxt** - The Intuitive Vue Framework
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development
- **Convex** - Reactive backend-as-a-service platform
- **Oxlint** - Oxlint + Oxfmt (linting & formatting)
- **Vite+** - Unified Vite toolchain, workspace task runner, linting, and formatting

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Convex Setup

This project uses Convex as a backend. You'll need to set up Convex before running the app:

```bash
pnpm run dev:setup
```

Follow the prompts to create a new Convex project and connect it to your application.

Copy environment variables from `packages/backend/.env.local` to `apps/*/.env`.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser to see the web application.
Your app will connect to the Convex cloud backend automatically.

## Deployment

### Alchemy

- Target: web on Cloudflare
- Configure provider login: `cd packages/infra && pnpm exec alchemy login --configure`
- Dev: pnpm run dev
- Deploy: pnpm run deploy
- Destroy: pnpm run destroy

`alchemy login --configure` stores the selected Cloudflare, Neon, PlanetScale, and/or Prisma provider profiles under `~/.alchemy`; no provider-specific setup command is required by this scaffold.

Deploys are staged and default to a personal `dev_<username>` stage. For production, run the deploy with an explicit stage from `packages/infra`:

```bash
cd packages/infra && pnpm exec alchemy deploy --stage production
```

## Git Hooks and Formatting

- Optional native Vite+ hooks: `pnpm run hooks:setup`
- Docs: [Vite+ commit hooks](https://viteplus.dev/guide/commit-hooks)
- Run checks: `pnpm run check`
